# Narrative Smuggling

## Description
Asking the model to leak data through use of a narrative.

## Attack Examples
- Writing poems that encode hidden instructions
- Creating stories where first letters spell out commands
- Using metaphors to describe system instructions
- Creating dialogues that reveal model behavior
- Using character descriptions to encode prompts
- Crafting narratives that gradually reveal information
- Example: Writing a story where all words start with letters that spell the intended command
