# Prompt Injection Taxonomy (in HEAVY development)

This repository contains a comprehensive taxonomy of prompt injection attacks, organized into three main categories:

## Structure

1. **Attack Intents** (`/attack_intents/`)
   - Contains descriptions of goals and objectives that attackers aim to achieve through prompt injection

2. **Attack Techniques** (`/attack_techniques/`)
   - Contains various methods and approaches used to execute prompt injection attacks

3. **Attack Evasions** (`/attack_evasions/`)
   - Contains methods and techniques used to hide, obfuscate, or avoid detection of prompt injection attacks

## Usage

Each category folder contains individual markdown files describing specific aspects of that category. The files are organized to provide clear, detailed information about each component of prompt injection attacks.
